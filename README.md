Makers project - Boris Bikes
============================


Third go at Boris Bikes project.
-------------------------------

This time round I want to focus on my rspec tests. I find it challenging to write good tests. And with the
realisation that my code will only be as good as my test I want to focus
on this area to ensure I create great code.

Here we go!
