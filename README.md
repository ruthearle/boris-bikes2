Boris Bikes
==========

Getting to know our way around Ruby (and classes, inheritance, mixins etc.) by implementing a bike hire scheme.

In groups, we hashed out a domain model of the problem using [CRC cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card). There was broad agreement that *Bike*, *Dock*, *Garage* and *Van* should feature; all of those are classes in this implementation.

Third go at Boris Bikes project.
-------------------------------

This time round I want to focus on my rspec tests. I find it challenging to write good tests. And with the
realisation that my code will only be as good as my test I want to focus
on this area to ensure I create great code.

Here we go!

On this repos I paired with:
